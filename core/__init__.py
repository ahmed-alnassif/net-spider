This project created by Ahmed Al-Nassif hoping to help you learn and understand how mega sites work and the way they write code, I don't take responsibility for doing illegal things like: stealing website ownership or tricking people into stealing their information... I designed this project to save you time and effort for learning and development, and you have the right to modify it to suit your needs
